# Welcome to the CircleCI AWS Ambassador Program

Welcome to CircleCI's AWS Ambassador Program! This program is designed for AWS Solution Architects seeking to familiarize themselves with CircleCI and understand how CircleCI can provide value for their customers.

By the end of the program, you should be equipped to discuss with customers what CircleCI is, where it fits in, and the value it provides. Further follow-up sessions will focus on specific features or use cases.

## Lab Structure

The program comprises two labs:

### Lab 1: Developer Experience

Lab 1 delves into the developer-centric realm of CircleCI, where participants set up CI/CD pipelines and orchestrate automated deployments. This lab equips you with the tools and knowledge to streamline development processes and deliver high-quality software confidently.

### Lab 2: Platform Team Perspective

Lab 2 explores CircleCI from the perspective of platform teams, focusing on governance, compliance, and scaling CI/CD infrastructure across the enterprise. Gain insights into configuring CircleCI for enterprise-grade deployments and driving innovation at scale.

## Milestones

Each lab is divided into milestones. In the Lab 1 and Lab 2 folders, you will find an overview of the lab, including objectives, prerequisites, and any additional details you might need. In the lab folders, you will find the `milestones` folder, which contains each "version" of the CircleCI configuration needed to complete the lab. The first milestone contains the most basic configuration, while the last milestone contains the full production config. You can refer to the milestone folders as you progress through the lab to see what changes are needed to reach the next milestone.
