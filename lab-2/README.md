## Milestones

The lab is structured into several milestones, each representing a step in implementing guardrails and best practices. In the `milestones` folder, you'll find the CircleCI configuration files corresponding to each milestone. Each milestone builds upon the previous one, gradually adding more advanced configurations and security measures to the CI/CD pipeline.

As you progress through the lab, refer to the milestone folders to understand the changes required to meet the objectives of each milestone.
